  title: "Learning world model dynamics via descriptive .urdf / .xml file"
  description: "Dynamic models in simulators such as mujoco are described using [.urdf](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modeling.html) files. Urdf files contain all information required for the simulation of system dynamics. One can now train a neural network via supervised learning that can directly predict the dynamics given only the .urdf file. Data from the simulator is used for ground truth during learning. The advantage is that a neural network is much quicker during inference than the simulator."

  title: "The role of stretch feedback in animal locomotion"
  description: "During my masters' thesis I worked on stretch feedback for salamander locomotion TODO: LINK. Upon finish of my masters' thesis I realized there are many open questions that can be addressed using DRL techniques: functional form of stretch feedback; integration of stretch feedback with CPGs; implementation on real robot. A major contributor in the field besides Auke Ijspeert is [CL Hamlet](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8qBAArYAAAAJ&hl=en)."
